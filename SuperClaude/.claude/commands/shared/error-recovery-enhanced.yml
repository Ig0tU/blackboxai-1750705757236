## Intelligent Retry Strategies

```yaml
Error_Classification:
  Transient_Errors:
    Network_Timeouts: "MCP server unreachable, API timeouts"
    Resource_Busy: "File locked, system overloaded"

Retry_Logic:
  Exponential_Backoff:

    Jitter: "Â±25% randomization to avoid thundering herd"
    
  Adaptive_Strategy:
    Network_Errors: "Retry w/ longer timeout"
    Rate_Limits: "Wait for reset period + retry"

    Permanent: "No retry, immediate fallback"
```

## MCP Server Failover

    Notification: "Inform user of performance impact"
```

## Context Preservation

```yaml

    Location: ".claudedocs/checkpoints/checkpoint-<timestamp>"
    
  During_Command_Chains:
    Intermediate_Results: "Save results after each successful step"

    State_Analysis: "Determine safe rollback point"
    User_Options: "Present recovery choices"

Context_Resilience:
  Session_State:
    Persistent_Storage: "Maintain state across interruptions"

```

## Proactive Error Prevention

```yaml
Pre_Execution_Validation:
  Environment_Check:
    Required_Tools: "Verify dependencies before starting"
    Permissions: "Check access rights for planned operations"
    Disk_Space: "Ensure adequate space for outputs"
    Network: "Verify connectivity for remote operations"
    
  Conflict_Detection:
    File_Locks: "Check for locked files before editing"

File_Lock_Scenario:
  Error: "Cannot edit file (locked by another process)"
  Recovery: "Wait 5s â†’ retry â†’ suggest alternatives"
  User_Experience: "Retrying in 5s... or try manual edit"
  
Command_Chain_Failure:
  Error: "Step 3 of 5 fails in build workflow"
  Recovery: "Preserve steps 1-2, suggest alternatives for 3"
  User_Experience: "Build partially complete. Alternative approaches: ..."
